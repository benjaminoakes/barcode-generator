# Barcode Creator

This repo is designed to convert any data, number and text into barcode. The barcode you produce is valid everywhere and when you read it with a barcode reader, it shows the data you entered. It is a very practical and fast way to encrypt or organize products.


Any data you convert to barcode will be valid everywhere. You can scan and save them with the barcode reader and organize the products in a shop.

In addition, you can use your passwords or data that you do not want anyone to see by converting them to barcodes.

It is not risky to make this conversion on the website. Because it is completely coded with vanilla JS. Since there is no database or registration network, you can use it with peace of mind. Moreover, all the codes are explained above.
  
## Run Locally

Clone the repo. ( If you clone after forking, you can both see the project in your own repo and want to develop it. That would make me very happy. )

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/fkkarakurt/barcode-creator.git
```

Go to the project directory.


That is all. You will see the `index.html` file in the root file of the downloaded clone. Open it with the internet browser you are using.
